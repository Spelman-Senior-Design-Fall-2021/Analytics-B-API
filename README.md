# Analytics B API

This is the source for a webservice than can be called to run Analytics B's models.

### Endpoints

#### /query
Accepts an HTTP POST request with JSON mapping a query_id to a value generated by webscraping. The service then retrieves the associated query data from the webscraping database, loads it into a data frame, runs the machine learning models, then stores the results and returns them as JSON in the response body.

### Development
- Work on branch then execute PR to merge in changes
- Server can be tested locally with ***flask run***
